# GeneFinder
GeneFinder: An automated tool for identification of genes and variants in VCF or annotated files of whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing data
The Gene_Finder is a Python program that can bewidely used in clinical applications for the identification of potential genes and variants inwhole-exome or whole-genome sequencing data. Starting from VCF or annotatedfiles in different formats (e.g. ‘.txt’, ‘.xlsx’, ‘.xls’), it will find genes whilespecifying their determined locations in files. The VCF or annotated filesare analyzed according to user-defined paths as well as results will bestored in the user-defined path. 
TheGene_Finder was tested and executed on a computer with Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise withan Intel Core i7 x64 processor, 2.5 GHz CPU, and 16 GB of RAM.
